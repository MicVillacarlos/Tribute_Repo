        <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <div>
            <p class="p">Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at 
            Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. 
            He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first freshman 
            in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record.
            The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. 
            During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals and 
            was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination, 
            attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and 
            Villanova were at the top of his list. However, after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 
            1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros.

        <h3>1996 NBA draft</h3>
          <div>
            <img class="img2" src="https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/950/605/f65748fde8b1f51fe686a79c5df2cdcf_crop_north.jpg?1403636727&w=3072&h=2048" 
            alt="Kobe NBA DRAFT 1996">
            <p class="p2">Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, 
                according to then-Laker manager Jerry West, "marched over these people".The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center 
                Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O'Neal. Bill Branch, the Charlotte Hornets' head scout at the time, 
                said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the 
                Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made. 
                Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30, Divac relented on his 
                threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when the league's off-season moratorium ended. Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until 
                he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began.[54] Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5 million.

        <h3>Three-peat (1999–2002)</h3>
          <div>
            <p class="p">Bryant's fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999. 
                After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, 
                earning appearances in the league's All-NBA,[74] All-Star, and All-Defensive teams. The Lakers 
                became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and O'Neal. Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. 
                Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.

        <h3>Scoring records and playoff upsets (2004–2007)</h3>
          <div>
            <img class="img2" src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/31/USAT/9e2ee9cc-e630-4c25-9405-fb2ff5bf09d8-LAL_--_Kobe_Bryant.jpg?crop=1619,911,x358,y504&width=1619&height=911&format=pjpg&auto=webp" 
            alt="Kobe vs Nuggets 2007">
            <p class="p2">Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that 
                had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: 
                A Team in Search of Its Soul. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and has 
                several criticisms of Bryant. In the book, Jackson called Bryant "un-coachable". Midway through the season, 
                Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion. 
                Without Tomjanovich, stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers' season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen.
                 Bryant was the league's second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast, 
                 and the Lakers went 34–48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. The year signified a drop in 
                 Bryant's overall status in the NBA, as he did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA 
                 Third Team. During the season, Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen.

        <h3>Back on top (2007–2010)</h3>
          <div>
            <p class="p">The Lakers concluded the 2007–08 regular season with a 57–25 record, finishing first in the Western Conference and setting 
                up themselves for a first-round contest against the Nuggets. In Game 1, Bryant, who said he made himself a decoy through most of the game, 
                scored 18 of his 32 points in the final eight minutes to keep Los Angeles safely ahead.[167] That made Denver the first 50-win team to be 
                swept out of the first round of the playoffs since the Memphis Grizzlies fell in four games to the San Antonio Spurs in 2004. 
                In the first game of the next round, against the Jazz, Bryant scored 38 points as the Lakers beat the Jazz in Game 1. 
                The Lakers won the next game as well, but dropped Games 3 and 4, even with Bryant putting up 33.5 points per game. 
                The Lakers then won the next two games to win the semifinals. This set up a Western Conference Finals berth against the 
                San Antonio Spurs. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in five games, sending themselves to the NBA Finals, against the Boston Celtics. 
                This marked the fifth time in Bryant's career, and the first time without O'Neal, that he made the NBA Finals. The Lakers then lost to the 
                Boston Celtics in six games.

            <p class="p2">At 9:06 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in 
                Orange County, California, with nine people aboard: Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, six family friends, and the pilot 
                ra Zobayan. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the
                California Secretary of State business database. The group was traveling to Camarillo Airport in Ventura County for a basketball 
                game at Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks.
                <br><br> 
                Due to light rain and fog that morning, the Los Angeles Police Department helicopters and most other air traffic were grounded.
                The flight tracker showed that the helicopter circled above the L.A. Zoo due to heavy air traffic in the area. At 9:30 a.m., 
                Zobayan contacted the Burbank Airport's control tower, notifying the tower of the situation, and was told he was "flying too low" 
                to be tracked by radar. At that time, the helicopter experienced extreme fog and turned south towards the mountains. At 9:40 a.m., 
                the helicopter climbed rapidly from 1,200 to 2,000 feet (370 to 610 m), flying at 161 knots (298 km/h; 185 mph).
